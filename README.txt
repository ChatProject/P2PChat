The is a simple example of using a java servlet to allow a client to retrieve 
data from a database on a server.

In this project, index.html can be used to send a post request with a display 
name to the ViewFriends servlet and the servlet will respond with the user's 
friends.

We could easily write a java or android program that would do the same thing as
index.html so the program could retrieve a list of friends.
